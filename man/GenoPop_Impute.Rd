\description{
Performs imputation of missing genomic data in batches using the missForest (Stekhoven & BÃ¼hlmanm, 2012) algorithm. This function reads VCF files, divides it into batches of a fixed number of SNPs, applies the missForest algorithm to each batch, and writes the results to a new VCF file, which will be returned bgzipped and tabix indexed. The choice of the batch size is critical for balancing accuracy and computational demand. We found that a batch size of 500 SNPs is the most accurate for recombination rates typical of mammalians. For on average higher recombination rates (> 5 cM/Mb) we recommend a batch size of 100 SNPs.
