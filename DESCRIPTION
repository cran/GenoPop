Description: Tools for efficient processing of large, whole genome genotype data sets in variant call format (VCF). It includes several functions to calculate commonly used population genomic metrics and a method for reference panel free genotype imputation, which is described in the preprint Gurke & Mayer (2024) <doi:10.22541/au.172515591.10119928/v1>.
